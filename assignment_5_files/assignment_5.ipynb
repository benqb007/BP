To ensure successful grading, please follow these instructions carefully: Name your notebook as `assignment_5.ipynb` before submission, as CodeGrade requires this specific filename for grading purposes. Additionally, make sure there are no errors in your notebook, as CodeGrade will not be able to grade it if errors are present. Before submitting, we highly recommend restarting your kernel and running all cells again to ensure that there will be no errors when CodeGrade runs your script."

    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate that sometimes regularization techniques can help address multicollinearity problems in your dataset. You will gain experience in building diverse regression models and evaluating their performance in comparison to a ridge regression regularized model. Additionally, you will practice utilizing grid search to obtain the optimal hyperparameters for your models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The data for this assignment is made-up and has been intentionally created in such a way that there is high correlation between predictor variables.  If your dataset includes predictor variables that exhibit strong correlations among themselves, ridge regression can sometimes be employed to alleviate multicollinearity by introducing a penalty term into the regression coefficients. This penalty term serves to restrain the coefficients, thus enhancing their stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please download the `ridge_reg_data.csv` file from Brightspace and put it in the same folder as this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Instructions\n",
    "Walk through the assignment and follow the directions as requested.  Once you have completed all the tasks, you are ready to submit your assignment to CodeGrade for testing. Please restart your notebook's kernel and run your code from the beginning to ensure there are no error messages. Once you have verified that the code runs without any issues, submit your .ipynb notebook file to CodeGrade for evaluation. Your notebook should be called `assignment_5.ipynb`. You have unlimited attempts for this assignment. "
